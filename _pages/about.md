I am an M.S. student in Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. I work on reliable embodied autonomy with a focus on multi-agent navigation, safe decision-making, and human–robot interaction.

## Research interests

- Reliable embodied autonomy and task/motion planning
- Multi-robot navigation and coordination (RL + MAPF)
- Human behavior modeling and safety-aware planning/control

## Selected publication

- **Deadlock-Free Hybrid RL-MAPF Framework for Zero-Shot Multi-Robot Navigation**  
  Haoyi Wang, Licheng Luo, Yiannis Kantaros, Bruno Sinopoli, Mingyu Cai.  
  arXiv:2511.22685, submitted to L4DC 2026. \[[Project page](https://wanghaoyi518.github.io/rl-mapf-project-page/)\]

## Highlights

- Integrated an LLM-based task planner with RL navigation and a safety-guaranteed MAPF fallback for deadlock resolution in multi-robot navigation.
- Built safety-aware planning methods for human-robot interaction by combining human action prediction with reachability analysis and MPC.
